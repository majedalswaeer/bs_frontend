# Booking System Webstie
- `Problem Domain` : To help buyers save their time, we decided to implement appointment booking system that
will allow them to book their appointment ahead of time before going to the service provider.
Hence, it is required to design and develop a solution that will allow the users to perform the
action smoothly.

## Website Functionality

- This Website has two types of users and interfaces for both `sellers` and `buyers`.

- Buyer can seach across the `sellers` and book an appointment with the desigred `seller`

- Once the `Buyer` click the book button, a popout alet will show and confirm that the request is sent to the desigred `seller`.

- One the `seller` logged in, the requests from the `buyers` will appear, the seller has the ability to accept and reject the requests.

- If the `seller` accepted the request, the appointment will be confirmed to the `buyer` and appear in the accepted appoinments section.
